What is Prognosis
Prognosis is our initiative in to ensure all the information like X-Rays, Transcriptions, Video Calls, Phone Interactions, Blood Reports etc. are all knitted together into a connected repository per patient and make the Patient - Doctor Interaction very productive , whilst ensuring all PII data is secured with OpenText API.

What Business Problem we have taken :
Today, Patient data is mostly unorganized or siloed in multiple systems and in multiple non-connected formats !

Even though we have capable online storage and manageable software systems, the challenge for manual storage to ensure compliance, privacy and lack of software to connect and tag all the artifacts..

Why we took three themes to develop the solution
As we understood, combining themes 3,4 and 5 is very much required in making an comprehensive and meaningful solution for having the full flow functional ! So we went ahead and developed all the three themes and knitted them.

Do we have a valid and functional solution
Prognosis has a 7-step detail workflow ensuring ingestion, PII detection/anonymization and a very interactive visual rich dashboard

Patient Data Organized in GDrive with encryption and anonymization to ensure accidental leaks will not hurt the overall privacy and compliance guidelines
Prognosis can scan images, videos, scanned copies and standardize Patient Data into a Normalized Format
Prognosis detects, extracts and masks PII and Risk Profile with OPENTEXT
Prognosis has rich UI to help in Data compliance
Ensure data is save with HIPAA, DISHA, PIPEDA compliance
A rich dashboard showing the journey of patient, unstructured documents previews and also all critical information
Conclusion
Prognosis is AI powered, can normalize and standardize any kind of data and keeps track of the overall Patient Journey. It has good features including rich visualization, mobile enablement and fully integrated with OpenText API
